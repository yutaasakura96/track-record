/**
 * Sorting — what replaced reviewing every fact by hand (issue #57, `docs/06`
 * 2026-10-08).
 *
 * A fact is accepted as it is extracted, with the importer's grade, and
 * anything worth the author's attention is FLAGGED with the reason. Three
 * things hold whatever the importer says:
 *
 *   - **Nothing is rejected here.** A fact the importer is unsure of, or gave
 *     no grade at all, is kept and flagged. The only candidates that never
 *     become facts are the ones `quote.ts` cannot find in the document.
 *   - **The scrub is a floor.** A shape match is Private whatever the importer
 *     read; the importer can only add to what is kept Private.
 *   - **Nothing imported is Public.** Restricted or Private, and the author
 *     promotes from there, one fact at a time.
